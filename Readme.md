# InstaSave Navigator

InstaSave Navigator is a Chrome extension that allows users to instantly jump to their **oldest saved Instagram post** using high-speed client-side scrolling.

Instagram does not provide a built-in way to navigate to the first saved post. This extension solves that problem in one click.
